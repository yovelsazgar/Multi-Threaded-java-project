# Multi-Threaded-java-project
Working with multy-threaded: Locking and synchronization, sleep & check, wait& notify etc.
A project that simulates the set game.
The game contains a deck of 81 cards. Each card contains a drawing with four features (color,
number, shape, shading).
The game starts with 12 drawn cards from the deck that are placed on a 3x4 grid on the table.
The goal of each player is to find a combination of three cards from the cards on the table that
are said to make up a “legal set”.
A “legal set” is defined as a set of 3 cards, that for each one of the four features — color,
number, shape, and shading — the three cards must display that feature as either: (a) all the
same, or: (b) all different (in other words, for each feature the three cards must avoid having
two cards showing one version of the feature and the remaining card showing a different
version).
The possible values of the features are:
▪ The color: red, green or purple.
▪ The number of shapes: 1, 2 or 3.
▪ The geometry of the shapes: squiggle, diamond or oval.
▪ The shading of the shapes: solid, partial or empty.
